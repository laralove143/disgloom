# ✨ Disgloom

Disgloom is a Discord API package for the Gleam programming language with the goal of being a feature-complete and easy-to-use library while still staying loyal to the Discord API.

The rationale of Disgloom is similar to that of [Twilight](https://twilight.rs), but with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
